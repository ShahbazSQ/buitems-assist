# BUITEMS Assist 🧠🎓

A smart, AI-powered chatbot built for BUITEMS University students — created over 3 semesters of dedication, learning, and experimentation.

This isn’t just another chatbot.

It’s my Final Year Project — a full-stack intelligent assistant that answers timetable questions, FAQs, and university-related queries using:
- 🧠 OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo
- 📚 FAISS + Sentence Transformers
- 📅 Pandas-powered timetable queries
- 💬 Natural Language Processing (SpaCy)
- 🛠️ Flask + SQLite + HTML/CSS/JS

> Built completely from scratch — with love, frustration, failure, and learning.

## 📌 Features

- 🕐 Ask for class timings like "When is DSA on Tuesday?"
- ❓ Ask university FAQs like "Where is the cafeteria?"
- 🤖 GPT fallback for open-ended queries
- 🔐 Admin panel to manage FAQs
- ⚙️ Built-in FAISS vector search for speed

## ❤️ A Note from the Developer

> This project wasn’t easy. I built this while managing full-time studies, assignments, and other responsibilities.  
>  
> I failed a lot. Fixed bugs that made no sense. Tried features that didn’t work.  
> But I kept going.  
>  
> If this repo helps you — as a student, a developer, or a dreamer — it was all worth it.

You’re free to use it, extend it, or just learn from it.
